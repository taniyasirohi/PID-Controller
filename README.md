📌 Introduction
A PID Controller is a type of feedback control system that maintains a desired output by adjusting the input. It is widely used in automation, process control, robotics, and energy systems to enhance stability and performance. The three components of a PID controller are:

Proportional (P): Reacts to the current error.
Integral (I): Eliminates past errors by summing them over time.
Derivative (D): Predicts future errors based on the rate of change.
📌 Problems Solved by PID Controllers
PID controllers help in:
✔️ Reducing system errors and improving precision.
✔️ Maintaining stability in dynamic systems.
✔️ Controlling temperature, pressure, and other process parameters.
✔️ Enhancing automation in industrial applications.

📌 Components of PID Controller
Error Detector - Measures the difference between the desired and actual output.
Proportional Controller (P) - Provides control action based on the error magnitude.
Integral Controller (I) - Eliminates steady-state error.
Derivative Controller (D) - Reduces overshoot by predicting future errors.
Actuator - Implements the control action.
