## **📌 Introduction**  
A **PID Controller** is a type of feedback control system that maintains a desired output by adjusting the input. It is widely used in **automation, process control, robotics, and energy systems** to enhance stability and performance. The three components of a PID controller are:  

- **Proportional (P):** Reacts to the current error.  
- **Integral (I):** Eliminates past errors by summing them over time.  
- **Derivative (D):** Predicts future errors based on the rate of change.

## **📌 Problems Solved by PID Controllers**  
PID controllers help in:  
✔️ Reducing system errors and improving precision.  
✔️ Maintaining stability in dynamic systems.  
✔️ Controlling temperature, pressure, and other process parameters.  
✔️ Enhancing automation in industrial applications.

## **📌 Components of PID Controller**  
1. **Error Detector** - Measures the difference between the desired and actual output.  
2. **Proportional Controller (P)** - Provides control action based on the error magnitude.  
3. **Integral Controller (I)** - Eliminates steady-state error.  
4. **Derivative Controller (D)** - Reduces overshoot by predicting future errors.  
5. **Actuator** - Implements the control action.

## **📌 Mathematical Representation**  
The PID controller’s output \( u(t) \) is given by:  

\[
u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int e(t) dt + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt}
\]

Where:  
- \( K_p \) = Proportional gain  
- \( K_i \) = Integral gain  
- \( K_d \) = Derivative gain  
- \( e(t) \) = Error signal  

---

## **📌 Tuning Methods**  
Tuning a PID controller means adjusting \( K_p \), \( K_i \), and \( K_d \) to achieve optimal system performance. The most common tuning methods are:  

✔️ **Ziegler-Nichols Method** – Experimental approach for setting gains.  
✔️ **Trial & Error Method** – Adjusting parameters manually.  
✔️ **Cohen-Coon Method** – A process model-based approach.  
✔️ **Software-Based Auto-Tuning** – Using algorithms for tuning.
